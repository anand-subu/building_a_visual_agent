# Implementing Agentic Object Detection

## Introduction

Agentic Object Detection was touched upon by Andrew Ng [recently](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewyng_introducing-agentic-object-detection-given-activity-7293302466249441280-GxAl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAABug4sMBXeiiqK6sYTENlHV1ZZl1T1l5neM), as part of [LandingAI](https://va.landing.ai/demo/agentic-od). The implementation is open-source and available on LandingAI's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/landing-ai/vision-agent).

This repository explores the mechanics of an agentic object detection pipeline. Traditionally, object detection has been a closed-vocabulary, closed-domain problem, where models could only detect objects they were explicitly trained on. These models lacked the flexibility to recognize objects beyond their training data. However, the emergence of multimodal models like CLIP has enabled open-vocabulary object detection models such as OWL-ViT, Florence, and DINO, which can detect objects in images based on text prompts.

While open-vocabulary models offer greater flexibility than their predecessors, they may still struggle to detect objects tied to nuanced concepts or interpret user queries accurately. Agentic Object Detection aims to bridge this gap by enabling a system to reason about a userâ€™s request and detect the relevant concepts in the image accordingly. LandingAI [demonstrated](https://landing.ai/agentic-object-detection) that their technique leads to improved performance on object detection benchmarks compared to other existing techniques

## Pipeline

This repository attempts to build an Agentic Object Detection pipeline using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) alongside Open-Vocabulary Object Detection models. Our approach involves a 5-step pipeline, where VLMs act as reasoning agents and reviewers, working in tandem with object detection models to refine and improve the detection process.

(Video was recorded using https://cursorful.com/ and edited using Flexclip for speeding up the video. The inference process is sped up by a higher factor for representation. The actual inference will take quite a bit of time. In  this repo, the demo video is only allowed for personal and non-commercial use to respect the terms of the Cursorful tool for free usage.

## Prior Work
This work is meant as our interpretation and exploration of how Agentic Object Detection could work - leveraging VLMs and Open Vocab Object Detection models. There has been prior work that has explored these concepts from similar angles. Please let me know if I have missed out any relevant work.

1. [LandingAI's implementation of Agentic Object Detection](https://github.com/landing-ai/vision-agent/blob/main/vision_agent/tools/tools.py) and their [associated blog post](https://landing.ai/agentic-object-detection)
2. [DetGPT: Detect What You Need via Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14167) - This concept also leverages VLMs to assist in detecting objects with nuanced concepts.
3. [How to Fine-tune PaliGemma for Object Detection Tasks](https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-fine-tune-paligemma/) - VLMs can theoretically be fine-tuned for object detection tasks - and this can include fine-tuning to detect objects for more nuanced user queries.
